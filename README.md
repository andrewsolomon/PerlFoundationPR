# Perl Foundation PR

PR materials for Perl Foundation PR activities.

The first goal is a "Perl Shop" search engine accessible via text search and maps.

## TODO

* Add a git checker to ensure that a company's description has the number of words, and doesn't use comparitives and superlatives
* Put together a draft site and make it password protected

# Notes

* The `draft` directory contains materials pending the organization's approval
* Record the approver of each entry
* Currently we have a 400 character limit on the organization's description.
